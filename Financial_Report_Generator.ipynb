        "**Problem Statement:**  \n",
        "Creating a financial report for a company or stock using the latest market and economic data, without the need for training or fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) or machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",

        "- This project leverages an open-source API to retrieve the latest financial and market data related to company metrics and economic indicators.\n",
        "- Python is used to process and save this data into a CSV file.\n",
        "- The CSV file is then loaded into a Vector Database with the help of an embedding model from Hugging Face.\n",
        "- A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) question-answering (QA) chain is built using Langchain, and the RAG architecture is implemented with the Falcon 7B LLM (an open-source model).\n",

        "\n",
        "**NOTE:**  \n",
        "While this tutorial uses open-source LLMs, the accuracy of the responses might not be as high. However, using models such as OpenAI's GPT or Meta's LLAMA can significantly improve the output accuracy, even with the same code."

What are my options?\\nHelpful Answer: As a 34-year-old female looking to invest in mutual funds for wealth creation over the next 1-3 years, you might consider the following options:\\n\\n1. **Equity Mutual Funds**: These funds primarily invest in stocks and have the potential for high returns, but they also come with higher risk. Given your investment horizon of 1-3 years, you might consider funds that focus on growth or mid-cap stocks.\\n\\n   - *Example*: Mirae Asset Emerging Bluechip Fund, SBI Magnum Midcap Fund\\n\\n2. **Debt Mutual Funds**: If you're risk-averse, debt funds could be a suitable option. They invest in fixed-income securities like bonds and offer lower risk and lower returns compared to equity funds.\\n\\n   - *Example*: HDFC Corporate Bond Fund, Aditya Birla Sun Life Short Duration Fund\\n\\n3. **Hybrid Mutual Funds**: These funds invest in a mix of equity and debt instruments, providing a balance between risk and return.\\n\\n   - *Example*: Parag Parikh Long Term Equity Fund, Axis Equity Hybrid Fund\\n\\n4. **Index Funds/ETFs**: These passively track a market index and are known for their low expense ratios. They can be a good option if you believe in the long-term growth of the market.\\n\\n   - *Example*: SBI ETF Nifty 50, UTI Nifty Index Fund\\n\\n5. **SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans)**: You can start a SIP in any of the above funds to invest a fixed amount regularly. This helps in rupee cost averaging and can be beneficial in the long run.\\n\\nBefore making a decision, consider your risk tolerance, financial goals, and investment horizon. It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.\"}"
